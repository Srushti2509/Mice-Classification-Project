# Mice-Classification-Project

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying mice using various machine learning techniques. The process includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and applying multiple classifiers to achieve optimal performance.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing the data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions, relationships between features, and identifying any potential patterns.
- **Feature Selection**: Selecting the most relevant features for improving model accuracy and reducing computational complexity.
- **Data Splitting**: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
- **Classification Models**:
  - **XGBClassifier**: A gradient boosting framework for robust classification.
  - **KNeighborsClassifier**: A simple, instance-based learning algorithm.
  - **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them together.
  - **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**: A powerful classifier that uses hyperplanes for separating classes.
  - **Decision Classifier**: A simple decision tree-based classifier.

## How to Run

1. **Dependencies**: Ensure that you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Notebook**: Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab and execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the results.

3. **Modify Parameters**: Feel free to adjust the parameters within the classifiers or data preprocessing steps to experiment with different results.

## Results

- The project compares the performance of different classifiers, evaluating them based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- The best model can be selected based on these metrics and applied to new data for classification.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a comprehensive example of applying multiple machine learning techniques for a classification task, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
